<b>What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?</b>
SSH(Secure Shell) keys are an access credential that us used in the SSH protocol. While working with github, we need to verify ourselves using our username and password. SSH key is an alternative way to verify ourselves.
SSH keys are more difficult to hack than passwords and thus are more secure.
