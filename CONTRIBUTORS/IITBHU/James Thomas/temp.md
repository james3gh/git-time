**Ques - 2 Should I make some issues on GitHub workflows for some Maven and Gradle projects?** <br/>
**Ans - 2** I am hearing this for the first time XD. Yes, you can make an issue so that we can learn .

**Ques - 4 If you have made only two commits for this task, then why there are only two, not three, and if there are three commits for this task then why there are three, not two?** <br/>
**Ans - 4** I made 3 commit for this task. As untracked file (temp.md) can be stashed by using git stash --all command, thus after stashing Ques 1, I made two stash seperately for Ques 2 and Ques 3.
If I stashed both ques 2 and 3 using all command then 2 commits would be needed.
